# Diabetes_Predictor
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in an individual. The model will utilize Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful classification algorithm, to analyze various medical features and identify patterns that differentiate between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
